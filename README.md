Here will be information about my app about MTA elevator/escalator outages

User Stories: The purpose is to be helpful for older people or people with injuries. People who can climb up/down one flight of stairs but it will be difficult to climb up/down many more flights of stairs. If they know the elevator/escalator is out of service, they can use another station or the bus, or they can wait for another time.

Received a developer key from the MTA but that is only necessary for real time tracking.
