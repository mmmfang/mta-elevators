	<p> This app for the the NYC subway system (MTA) will tell you which elevators and escalators are out of service. If you don't want to or cannot walk up multiple flights of stairs, you will know before struggling up the stairs and encountering a broken elevator or escalator. This app will be useful for seniors, those with limited mobility, people with strollers, or anyone who doesn't feel like taking the stairs!</p>

	<p>Outage information is updated every 5 minutes, providing relevant information including which station is affected, the location and reason for the equipment outage, and the elevator/escalator predicted to return to service.</p>

	<p>This app was created during General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in NYC. See the <a href="http://www.github.com/mmmfang/mta-elevators">Github repo.</a></p>
