	<p> This app for the the NYC subway system (MTA) will tell you which elevators and escalators are out of service. If you cannot or don't want to walk up multiple flights of stairs, you will know before you've struggled up the stairs only to encounter a broken elevator or escalator. The target audience is people with limited mobility, seniors, those with strollers, or anyone who just doesn't feel like taking the stairs!</p>

	<p>Outage information is updated every 5 minutes and provides relevant information such as the station affected, the location and reason for the equipment outage, and when the elevator/escalator is predicted to return to service.</p>

	<p>This app was created during General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in NYC. For code, see the<a href="http://www.github.com/mmmfang/mta-elevators"> Github repo.</a></p>
