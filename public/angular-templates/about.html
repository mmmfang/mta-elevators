This app is for the the NYC subway system (MTA) and will tell you which elevators and escalators are out of service, allowing you to avoid those stations if you don't want to or cannot walk up multiple flights of stairs. It will enable you to consider other forms of transportation before you struggle up or down a flight of stairs, only to encounter a broken escalator. This app will be useful for seniors, those with limited mobility, people with strollers, or anyone who doesn't feel like taking the stairs!

The outage information is updated every 5 minutes. It provides relevant information including which station is affected, the location and reason for the equipment outage, and when the elevator/escalator is predicted to return to service.

This was created as a final project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program in NYC. The Github repo is here http://www.github.com/mmmfang/mta-elevators
